ATM Simulation System – Python
Abstract

Objective:
To develop a console-based ATM Simulation System that performs user authentication, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, cash deposit, and mini statement operations.

Tools and Techniques:
The system is implemented using Python, with dictionaries for account data storage and lists for transaction history. Exception handling is used to manage invalid inputs.

Loops and Functions:
While loops control login attempts and menu-driven execution, while for loops handle user verification and transaction display. Core functionalities are implemented using user-defined functions for modular and reusable code.

Concepts Used:
The project applies conditional statements, loops, functions, data structures, and error handling to simulate real-world ATM operations.
